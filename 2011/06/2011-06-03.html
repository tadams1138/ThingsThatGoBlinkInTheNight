    <h1>Change Passwords in Sharepoint without using Forms Authentication</h1>
    <p>When we initially built the server, we went with Windows Authentication partly because we didn't know better, but
        also because we don't want to complicate the situation with more complicated kinds of authentication. There is
        one major drawback to the Windows Authentication method: changing a user account password required them to log
        onto the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc706993(WS.10).aspx">Windows Server 2003</a> box
        -- by which I mean the regular Windows desktop -- go to Control Panel and do all those steps that you would do
        to change the Windows password on your personal machine. This is kind of a pain since I don't want to know other
        people's passwords when they ask me to type it for them nor I don't want to enable Remote Desktop or other
        VNC-like applications on this server.</p>

    <p>I had a developer do some research for me on what it would take to enable our users to change their password on
        our <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/project/en/us/project-2007-server.aspx">Project Server 2007</a> box.
        According to their extensive research, we needed to switch to Forms Authentication, and it was kind of a
        difficult process to switch from Windows Authentication to Forms Authentication. We only have a small team of
        developers, and none of us are Sharepoint experts. We had to throw this problem on the back burner since we just
        didn't have the time or the resources to dedicate to this problem.</p>

    <p>But lucky for me, a little bing-ing (what do you call it when you search the web using <a
            href="http://bing.com/">bing.com</a>?) later, I found a solution! There are a few Web Parts you can buy <a
            href="http://www.sharepointboost.com/passwordchange.html">here</a> and <a
            href="http://store.bamboosolutions.com/sharepoint-password-change-web-part.aspx">here</a>, but if you don't
        want to spend close to a thousand dollars for a solution (which I don't), you can find a free Web Part, <a
                href="http://changepassword.codeplex.com/">ITaCS Change Password web part</a>. Go download this tool,
        run the installer from your Sharepoint server and just follow the instructions available for download as a PDF
        on the same site you downloaded the installer.</p>

    <p>There is one step the instructions leave out though for those of us who are not Sharepoint-literate. In order for
        you to see the Change Password form, you must pick the page you want the Change Password Web Part to appear on,
        click the Site Actions button in the upper right corner, click Edit Page, click on whatever “Add a Web Part”
        button you want, scroll down the popup that appears and check the ITaCS Change Password item, then click Add. At
        this point you can pick up where their documentation tells you to click the “tool pane” link. When you are all
        done, configuring the Web Part, you need to click “Exit Edit Mode” in the upper right corner, and you are all
        done.</p>

    <p>Now we can change our passwords without sitting in front of the server. Hurray!</p>
