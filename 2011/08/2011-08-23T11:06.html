        <h1>Obfuscating with Dotfuscator</h1>
        <h3>Without installing Dotfuscator to every engineer's system</h3>
    </header>

    <p>.Net assemblies are easily deconstructed into readable code. You can use tools like Red-Gate's Reflector (<a
            href="http://www.reflector.net/">http://www.reflector.net/</a>) or ILSpy (<a
            href="http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/ILSpy.ashx">http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/ILSpy.ashx</a>) to view the
        contents of a .Net assembly. This poses a problem both for intellectual property reasons where we don't want our
        competitors to know how we did something as well as for security reasons where we don't want a hacker to know
        what our security algorithms might be. For this reason, we must obfuscate and encrypt our code. Obfuscation
        simply makes the assembly harder to read, not impossible to read. So it acts as a deterrent to anyone we don't
        explicitly want reading our code.</p>

    <h2>Our process</h2>
    <p>Each engineer is responsible with making sure their code is properly obfuscated before it is released. They have
        to make sure their project contains all the necessary code so that it gets obfuscated. Following that, they
        commit their code to the code server which will compile and obfuscate it before copying it to the Latest Builds
        shared folder on our network.</p>

    <p>The .NET Framework provides custom attributes designed to make it easy to automatically obfuscate assemblies
        without having to set up configuration files. You can read about those here: <a
                href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms227281.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms227281.aspx</a>.
        We use Dotfuscator by Preemptive (<a href="http://www.preemptive.com/">http://www.preemptive.com/</a>) to
        obfuscate our assemblies. Dotfuscator will read the custom attributes in .Net and act accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Create a post-build event to obfuscate your build output</h2>
    <p>In VB.Net go to the project properties, select Compile and click the Build Events... button

    <p>In C# go to the project properties and click on Build Events.</p>

    <p>The following script will obfuscate the assembly post-compile.</p>

    <pre><code>IF $(ConfigurationName) == Release (
   IF EXIST "$(dotfuscator)" (
      IF NOT EXIST "$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)" md "$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)"
      IF NOT EXIST "$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)\map.xml" copy "$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\map.xml" "$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)"
      "$(dotfuscator)" /in:"$(TargetPath)" /out:"$(TargetDir)Obfuscated" /honor:on /strip:on /prune:off /enhancedOI:on /suppress:on /mapin:"$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)\map.xml" /mapout:"$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)\map.xml" /debug:pdb
      copy /Y "$(TargetDir)Obfuscated\$(TargetFileName)" "$(TargetPath)"
      rmdir /S /Q "$(TargetDir)Obfuscated"
   )
)
</code></pre>

    <p><code>$(dotfuscator)</code> refers to an Environment variable (like Path or Windir). If it is not set on your
        system (it should only be set on the build machine) then the <code>IF EXIST</code> statement will be false and
        the rest of the script will not run.</p>

    <p><code>$(ObfuscationMapFolder)</code> refers to an Environment variable (like Path or Windir). It should contain
        the path to the location of the map files.</p>

    <p>The options set in this example are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>To “honor” obfuscation attributes to be detailed in later slides as opposed to ignoring those attributes.
        </li>
        <li>To “strip” obfuscation attributes out of the assemblies. This makes it more difficult for anyone to
            determine what our obfuscation strategy was.
        </li>
        <li>Prune is off. We do not need to remove “unused” classes. Enabling this option has given me headaches in the
            past since it will remove classes not specifically mentioned in code, but rather mentioned elsewhere like in
            the app config file. The classes may actually be in use, but the obfuscation engine just can't tell. If a
            class is unnecessary in a compile, remove it from the project yourself. Don't expect the obfuscator to do
            it.
        </li>
        <li>“EnhancedOI:on” enables Enhanced Overload Induction. EnhancedOI enables a method's return type or a field's
            type to be used as a criterion in determining method or field uniqueness. This feature can allow up to 15
            percent more redundancy in method and field renames. In addition, since overloading on method return type or
            field type is typically not allowed in source languages (including C# and VB), this further hinders
            decompilers.
        </li>
        <li>Suppress is on. It adds the SuppressIldasmAttribute attribute to the assembly which prevents the Ildasm.exe
            (MSIL Disassembler) from disassembling it.
        </li>
        <li>The map file options indicate where to write the map file as well as where to read the previous map file.
            Dotfuscator reads the previous map file to find out what the assembly's elements were renamed to so that it
            can rename them consistently. When you add new elements to rename, those elements are added and written to
            the new map file. The old map file is renamed usually. The map file helps you debug a stack trace where the
            names of methods are completely unhelpful (e.g. method a() called method b() ). Use the “Lucidator” tool to
            debug a stack trace using a map file.
        </li>
        <li>The debug option is set to generate pdb file which can be used to debug an assembly while it is running.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can run Dotfuscator.exe with the /? option from the command line to get a list of all available options and
        their defaults. We use the default settings for everything except the above mentioned settings. We also specify
        prune be set to off (it's default) only because dotfuscator appears to prune classes if I do not specify it.</p>

    <h2>Environment variables</h2>
    <p>Got to thank the guys at stackoverflow.com for tipping me off to this (<a
            href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/128634/how-to-use-system-environment-variables-in-vs-2008-post-build-events">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/128634/how-to-use-system-environment-variables-in-vs-2008-post-build-events</a>).
    </p>

    <p>You can reference any environment variable in the pre or post-build events by stating it like this <code>$(variableName)</code>.
        This can be helpful when trying to determine if your system has certain components installed or not during the
        build process. Otherwise the build process would report a failure if the build event returned an error.</p>

    <h2>Nested Conditional Statements and other neat command line tricks</h2>
    <p>The build events are treated exactly the same as the commands in a batch file. Certain commands, such as for,
        goto, and if, enable you to do conditional processing of the commands in the build event. For example, the if
        command carries out a command based on the results of a condition. Other commands allow you to control output
        and call other batch files. For more information about batch file operations, see <a
                href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds.mspx?mfr=true">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds.mspx?mfr=true</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Add a call statement before all post-build commands that run .bat files.</p>

    <p>For a full list of commands you can use in a build event try <a
            href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds.mspx?mfr=true">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds.mspx?mfr=true</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Add assembly attributes</h2>
    <p>You should add the following attributes to the Assembly file.</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;Assembly: ObfuscateAssemblyAttribute(True, StripAfterObfuscation:=True)&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>The <code>ObfuscateAssemblyAttribute</code> attribute instructs dotfuscator to use its standard obfuscation rules
        for the appropriate assembly type.</p>

    <p>The first argument, <code>assemblyIsPrivate</code>, is set to <code>True</code> in the example code above. It
        should be true for any assembly that will not be referenced by other assemblies. A public assembly, a library
        referenced by another assembly for instance, should have this argument set to False so that the obfuscator will
        use default settings appropriate for a public assembly.</p>

    <p>The <code>StripAfterObfuscation</code> property is <code>true</code>, to so that the attributes are stripped
        after processing.</p>

    <p>Remember to import (using in C#) the System.Reflection namespace to use the ObfuscateAssembly attribute.</p>

    <h2>To prevent renaming of a specific class</h2>
    <p>You may have a class or structure referenced by name elsewhere. For instance an application configuration file
        may reference a class by name</p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <pre class="vb"><code>&lt;userNameAuthentication userNamePasswordValidationMode="Custom"
        customUserNamePasswordValidatorType="GCDataService.Configuration.SetConfigurationUserNameValidator,GCDataService"/&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>We do not want to rename this class, but we have no problem obfuscating the class's contents. So we write this
        attribute above the class</p>

    <pre class="vb"><code>&lt;Obfuscation(ApplyToMembers:=False, Exclude:=True)&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>This will exclude the class from the obfuscation rules, but all class members will still have the default
        obfuscation rules applied to it. Remember to import (using in C#) the System.Reflection namespace to use the
        Obfuscation attribute.</p>

    <h2>To prevent a class from having any part of it obfuscated</h2>
    <p>You may have a class or structure that needs to be publicly exposed and you don't want any part of it obfuscated.
        Instances of this might be WCF endpoint contracts (interfaces).</p>

    <p>We do not want to rename this class, no do we want to obfuscate any of its contents. So we write this attribute
        above the class:</p>

    <pre class="vb"><code>&lt;Obfuscation(ApplyToMembers:=True, Exclude:=True)&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>This will exclude the class/structure and all of its members from the obfuscation rules. Remember to import
        (using in C#) the System.Reflection namespace to use the Obfuscation attribute.</p>

    <h2>To encrypt the contents of a string</h2>
    <p>The string constants that you enter into a .Net assembly are easily readable. If they contain anything remotely
        sensitive, you must encrypt them before we release them to the public.</p>

    <p>An example of a string you need to encrypt:</p>

    <pre class="vb"><code>Private Shared Function ConnectionString() As String
    Return "Password=1234;Data Source=" &amp; PermissionsDB
End Function</code></pre>

    <p>To encrypt the contents of a function add the following attribute to the top of the method to encrypt:</p>

    <pre class="vb"><code>&lt;Obfuscation(Feature:="stringencryption", Exclude:=False)&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>You must set Exclude to false, because the default for string encryption is to not encrypt (ie exclude) all
        methods. Store sensitive strings inside of functions or methods that you can add this attribute to. You cannot
        apply this attribute to a variable, so do not assign a sensitive string to a member variable of a class on the
        same line where you declare that variable. Remember to import (using in C#) the System.Reflection namespace to
        use the Obfuscation attribute.</p>
    <p>And that is all I have to say about that.</p>
