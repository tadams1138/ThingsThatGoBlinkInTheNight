        <h1>TeamCity, Dotfuscator and those map files</h1>
    </header>

    <p>If you're like me, and I know I am, you are asking yourself “What is the best way to keep track of your
        obfuscation map files?”</p>

    <p>We have an SVN server connected to a TeamCity build server. Every time someone makes a change in the code and
        commits it to the SVN server, the TeamCity server attempts to make a build from the code. During the build
        process, the resulting .Net assemblies are obfuscated and encrypted with our copy of Dotfuscator from Preemptive
        (<a href="http://www.preemptive.com">http://www.preemptive.com</a>).</p>

    <p>The obfuscation process produces an xml document, map.xml, which is necessary to de-obfuscate a stack trace among
        other things. We need these map files. We need a history of these map files so that they are consistent. You
        don't want function “StartServer()” to get renamed to “a()” one day and renamed to “b()” then next. How in the
        world will you know what the stack trace could possibly mean from one build to the next? Dotfuscator allows you
        to use the old map file as a reference point for any new map file, so that you will always be able to
        de-obfuscate your code without the headache of wondering which version of the software this stack trace might
        refer to.</p>

    <p>Not only do we want to take advantage of this feature in Dotfuscator, we still want to keep a running history of
        these map files to prevent mistakes made (someone deletes the map file, etc). Dotfuscator is smart about this
        process to. You may specify the exact same name for both the old and new map files, and it will rename the old
        map file to map.0.xml for instance and save the new one as map.xml. If you obfuscate your assembly again, it
        will rename the last map.xml to map.1.xml and save a new map file as map.xml. This way the most recent map file
        is always map.xml, the second most recent is map.largest-integer.xml, and the oldest is map.0.xml.</p>

    <p>Here is my problem: TeamCity checks out a “working copy” from the SVN. I wanted to script it so that the new map
        file produced (map.xml) would be committed to the SVN server. Then when it came time for TeamCity to build
        again, it could check the map.xml file out and not worry about not having the right copy. What if I had to
        delete the “working copy” from the build server because of some glitch? Should I lose my most recent map file in
        the process? Alas, you cannot commit a file to the SVN server if it is in a mere “working copy” and not a
        “checkout” from the SVN.</p>

    <p>I thought about trying to change TeamCity's settings from downloading a working copy to checking out the code… I
        don't know how, and I'm not even convinced that's a good idea.</p>

    <p>I thought about trying to find a round-about way to copy the map files to the SVN, perhaps by copying them to a
        fully checked out folder? Sounds like way too much work and probably error prone.</p>

    <p>Eventually I settled on an idea that seems to work for us: I included this build script in the post-build event
        for any of our projects to be obfuscated when they are compiled on the build server (numbered only so I can
        refer the lines below):</p>

    <pre><code>1. IF $(ConfigurationName) == Release (
2.    IF EXIST "$(dotfuscator)" (
3.        IF NOT EXIST "$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)" md "$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)"
4.        IF NOT EXIST "$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)\map.xml" copy "$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\map.xml" "$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)"
5.        "$(dotfuscator)" /in:"$(TargetPath)" /out:"$(TargetDir)Obfuscated" /honor:on /strip:on /prune:off /enhancedOI:on /suppress:on /mapin:"$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)\map.xml" /mapout:"$(ObfuscationMapFolder)\$(ProjectName)\map.xml" /debug:pdb
6.        copy /Y "$(TargetDir)Obfuscated\$(TargetFileName)" "$(TargetPath)"
7.        rmdir /S /Q "$(TargetDir)Obfuscated"
8.    )
9. )
</code></pre>

    <p>Line 1 is used to skip obfuscation if we are not using the release configuration so we don't waste time when we
        produce debug assemblies.</p>

    <p>Line 2 is used to skip this whole process if you don't have Dotfuscator installed. You see I have “dotfuscator”
        as an environment variable assigned a path to the dotfusctator executable. If you don't have that variable set
        in your environment, this script assumes you don't have Dotfuscator installed (note: I created this environment
        variable manually), and skips the rest of the script.</p>

    <p>Line 3 checks to see if there is a folder on the system (my build system) that exists at
        %ObfuscationMapFolder%\$(ProjectName). If there isn't, it creates this folder. ObfuscationMapFolder, like
        “dotfuscator” is an environment variable I created. It points to a specific folder on my server. This folder is
        shared over the network with read only access. Any of the developers on my team can read (but not write to) all
        of the contents of this folder and its subfolders.</p>

    <p>Line 4 copies an empty template map file to the project folder if no map file exists there yet. The reason for
        this is Dotfuscator will fail if you specify an old map file to use and it cannot find it. It also must be a
        valid map file. The file I copy contains this:</p>

    <pre class="xml"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE dotfuscatorMap SYSTEM "http://www.preemptive.com/dotfuscator/dtd/dotfuscatorMap_v1.1.dtd"&gt;
&lt;dotfuscatorMap version="1.1"&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;timestamp&gt;2010-09-30T19:07:23&lt;/timestamp&gt;
        &lt;product version="4.8.1000.25803" user="John Doe" serial="1234-5678-9101"&gt;Dotfuscator Professional Edition&lt;/product&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;mapping /&gt;
    &lt;statistics /&gt;
&lt;/dotfuscatorMap&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>In line 5 I actually call the Dotfuscator (using the environment variable “dotfuscator” pointing to the
        Dotfuscator executable). I specify all of my default options especially the location of the old map file and the
        location I want it to write a new map file.</p>

    <p>In line 6 and 7 I copy the newly created obfuscated assembly over the old un-obfuscated assembly and delete the
        unnecessary “Obfuscated” folder created during the obfuscation process.</p>

    <p>So now I have an easily accessible folder of map files for anyone on my dev team who needs to use Lucidator to
        decipher a stack trace. I also have a history of all of my map files by project. In addition to that I include
        that shared folder in my server's regular backup process so I have redundancy in my backups.</p>

    <p>This solution is not as convenient as everyone being able to update their SVN checkouts to get the latest map
        files on their system, but it's the best I could come up with. And it seems to be working just fine now.</p>
