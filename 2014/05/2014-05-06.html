    <h1>Parrot releases AR.FreeFlight for Windows 8</h1>
    <p><a href="http://blog.parrot.com/2014/04/30/ar-freeflight-comes-to-the-windows-store/">Parrot announced on April
        30th</a> the release of AR Freeflight for Windows 8. It has live video, and it's free! I still have a couple of
        other features I'm in the middle of implementing in my free time (including a bug fix to a crash during startup
        that several people are experiencing), but it's going to be a hard task to play catch up with the Parrot team
        for a better app.</p>
