    <h1>Segregating Integration tests from Unit tests in VS2013</h1>
    <p>If you're like me, and I know I am, you want to run your unit tests as often and as quickly as possible. You also
        need integration tests to verify that the overall system works as intended. I let the TFS build agent run the
        whole suite of tests either upon every check-in or on a schedule depending upon the project. But I don't want to
        segregate out the integration tests from the test projects necessarily. Do I really want an
        Acme.Web.Api.UnitTests project and an Acme.Web.Api.IntegrationTests? I think I'd prefer an Acme.Web.Api.Tests
        project with both unit tests, integration tests or any other tests inside that library.</p>

    <p>So how do I get the quick turnaround whenever I run all tests (Ctrl+R, A)?</p>

    <p>I found that I can categorize the tests via the [TestCategory] attribute and then filter them out in the Test
        Explorer window. Like this:</p>

    <img src="segregating%20integration%20tests.png" alt="Test category filtering">

    <p>So now I can quickly run all tests (Ctrl+R, A) sans the tests marked "Integration" without separating out the
        integration tests from the solution or worse, disabling integration tests until I'm "ready." The build agent
        machine will never know about my filter since that is information not saved to TFS. My local system however will
        remember my filter so that I can quickly select my filter from the filter drop down in Test Explorer every time
        I start up Visual Studio 2013.</p>
