    <h1>Restricting Bad Websites in IE After IT has Applied Group Policy</h1>
    <p>In case you didn't already know, you can block poorly made sites from running JavaScript/Flash/etc. in Internet
        Explorer by <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/174360">adding them to the Restricted Sites security
            zone</a>. In 8 clicks (I know it's a lot, but I usually only have to use it once), I can prevent a site from
        running all those obnoxious ads and scripts and let me just read the content. I've been able to block Drudge
        Report's meta refresh and WashingtonTimes's ads.</p>

    <p>Why not use Browser X which is vastly superior to IE in every way, you ask? Because I'm not a browser fan-boy,
        that's why. I don't feel like installing a new browser on every machine I own or use. IE favorites and settings
        sync across my devices, and I like this feature. Also, your "my browser is faster!" claim has not been a
        human-measurable value since IE 6. More than likely your intense hatred for IE is based soley on your experience
        with IE 6 which is kind of irrational when you consider they are on version 11. Nothing against other browsers
        (except Firefox, you suck as a company!), but IE is a perfectly cromulent browser that grandma can use. There is
        no need to force grandma to download a new browser, you weird browser fanboys.</p>

    <p>This was all working just fine for me until our IT dept decided to add my company laptop to the domain and group
        policy took away my ability to add sites to the Restricted Sites security zone. Well, I found a way around this,
        and it looks like I might be able to add sites in fewer clicks if I automate this process a little. My logon is
        a local administrator account on my laptop, and that may be a requirement to follow these steps.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Run Internet Explorer as Administrator<br/>
            <ol>
                <li>Right click Internet Explorer icon in the taskbar</li>
                <li>Right click Internet Explorer in the context menu</li>
                <li>Click Properties<br/>
                    <img src="1.png" alt="Run as administrator"></li>
                <li>Under the Shortcut tab, click Advanced<br/>
                    <img src="2.png" alt="Internet Explorer Properties"></li>
                <li>Check Run as administrator<br/>
                    <img src="3.png" alt="Advanced Properties"></li>
                <li>Click OK</li>
                <li>Click OK</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Add sites to the Restricted Sites zone registry key<br/>
            <ol>
                <li>Type <strong>regedit.exe</strong> at the Start menu and hit [Enter]</li>
                <li>Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
                    Settings\ZoneMap\Domains
                </li>
                <li>Right click Domains, click New->Key<br/>
                    <img src="4.png" alt="new key"></li>
                <li>Name the new key after the domain name to restrict (e.g. washingtontimes.com)</li>
                <li>Select this new key and right click inside the right pane, click New->DWORD (32-bit) Value<br/>
                    <img src="5.png" alt="new DWORD"></li>
                <li>Name this new value the protocol you want to restrict (e.g. http, https, etc.)</li>
                <li>Double click this value to open the Edit DWORD (32-bit) Value dialog<br/>
                    <img src="6.png" alt="Edit DWORD"></li>
                <li>Change Value data to 4, and click OK.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The next time you visit a domain listed now in your registry, you should notice that it isn't running JavaScript
        or other time consuming, annoying features.</p>

    <p>I hope to automated the addition of sites to my registry in the near future. I'll blog about it if I do.</p>

    <h2>Update (2015-01-23):</h2>

    <p>Apparently I need to block group policy from changing my registry values too.</p>
    <p>Open up regedit.exe again</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Right click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
            Settings\ZoneMap\Domains and clicked on <strong>Permissions...</strong> from the context menu.
        </li>
        <li>Click on <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Disable inheritance</strong> and select <strong>Convert inherited permissions into explicit
            permissions on this object</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Click the <strong>SYSTEM</strong> account and the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Uncheck <strong>Full Control</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Change</strong> at the top next to <strong>Owner: SYSTEM</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Locations</strong> and set the location to your local machine.</li>
        <li>Enter <strong>Administrators</strong> into the dialog box and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
        <li>Check <strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> again.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I'll let you know if that doesn't prevent group policy from overwriting my entries.</p>

    <h2>Update (2015-02-04)</h2>

    <p>Apparently that didn't work either. I'm going to further restrict SYSTEM and let you know how that goes.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Follow all the previously mentioned steps if it looks like your registry changes have been reverted.</li>
        <li>Right click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
            Settings\ZoneMap\Domains and clicked on <strong>Permissions...</strong> from the context menu.
        </li>
        <li>Click on <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>SYSTEM</strong> account and the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Change Type to <strong>Deny</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click Show Advanced Permissions and check <strong>Set Value</strong>, <strong>Create Subkey</strong>,
            <strong>Create Link</strong>, <strong>Delete</strong>, <strong>Write DAC</strong>, <strong>Write
                Owner</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Add</strong>, click <strong>Select a Principal</strong>, set location to your local machine,
            enter <strong>SYSTEM</strong> where it says <strong>Enter the object name to select (examples):</strong> and
            click <strong>OK</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Check <strong>Read</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You should now have denied the SYSTEM account all ability to alter the Domains registry key as well as any child
        nodes, but it should still be able to read it.</p>
