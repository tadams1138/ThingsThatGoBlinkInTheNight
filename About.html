<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am Tom Adams, a software developer in the Tampa area since 2004 and specialize in .Net applications. I've worked in
    all development environments from little to no organization.</p>

<p>I am a US Marine and enjoy quality rum, fine cigars and watching baseball or Star Wars. I have many founded and
    (mostly) unfounded opinions on religion and politics and would be glad to discuss them with you in combination with
    any of the aforementioned.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and I also have some kids and a wife or something. Sometimes they like to hang out with me. I run
    half-marathons to keep my wife interested in me.</p>

<h1>About the blog title</h1>
<p>I have to credit my wife for that. I was trying to tell her one day to reset the wireless router in the house. As I
    attempted to describe what hardware she needed to reset, she blurted out "Oh, the thing that goes blink in the
    night?" It stuck with me.</p>
