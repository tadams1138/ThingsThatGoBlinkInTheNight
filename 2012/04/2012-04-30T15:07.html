        <h1>Linking .Net software versions to repository versions using TeamCity</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I tried to link the version numbers of our compiled files to the revision number of the SVN when the source that
        the file was built on was committed. My goal is to have a version number for every binary that looks like
        MAJOR.MINOR.TEAMCITY_BUILD.SVN_REVISION.</p>

    <p>TeamCity has a handy tool on the <strong>Build Steps</strong> page of the project's build configuration. At the
        bottom where it says "<strong>Additional Build Features</strong>", you can add "<a
                href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD65/AssemblyInfo+Patcher">AssemblyInfo patcher</a>"
        which will set the whole version number in every AssemblyInfo.* file in your project. Very handy... unless you
        want to be Mr. Special-case like myself.</p>

    <p>You see, I have several .Net projects within this one TeamCity project, and they need different major and minor
        versions. Several of these projects have already gone through multiple development iterations, so I have a 4.X
        version of one program, and a 1.X version of another. I have a need to increment the Major and Minor versions of
        several different projects separately, but I still want to apply the TEAMCITY_BUILD.SVN_REVISION numbers too. I
        don't much like the idea of syncing up all the major and minor version numbers, nor do I really want to figure
        out the best way to break all the projects up into different TeamCity projects linking them via dependencies or
        whatever.</p>

    <p>Peter von Lochow <a href="http://blog.jayway.com/2011/09/07/setting-assemblyversion-number-in-teamcity-6-5/">posted</a>
        about this very need, and solves my problem in his comments section.</p>

    <p>So here's my slightly modified solution based on Peter von Lochow's comment:</p>

    <p>Set the <strong>Build number format</strong> in the <strong>General Settings</strong> section of the project's
        configuration to <samp>{0}.%build.vcs.number%</samp> - in this case, that is the build counter followed by the
        SVN revision number.</p>

    <p>Add a <strong>Powershell</strong> build step to the TeamCity project, and reorder the build steps so that this
        new step is the first to run.

    <p>Set <strong>Powersehll run mode</strong> to <strong>x86</strong>, set <strong>Script</strong> to <strong>Source
        code</strong>, and set <strong>Script execution mode</strong> to <strong>Put script into PowerShell stdin with
        "-Command -" arguments</strong>.

    <p>Script source:</p>

    <pre><code>(Get-childitem -include AssemblyInfo.* -recurse) | Foreach-Object { sc $_ ((Get-content $_) -replace '^(.*AssemblyVersion\(\"\d\.\d)\..+(\"\).*)$', '$1.%build.number%$2' -replace '^(.*AssemblyFileVersion\(\"\d\.\d)\..+(\"\).*)$', '$1.%build.number%$2')}</code></pre>

    <p>That regular expression will replace whatever falls between the major.minor version numbers and ") with whatever
        we set the <strong>Build number format</strong> in Teamcity - in this case we set it to the build counter and
        the SVN revision number.</p>

    <p>Now Teamcity will compile with build numbers and SVN revision numbers in the file versions. This should make it
        much easier when trying to track bugs found in deployed files now that you can match up a snapshot of the SVN to
        that compile.</p>

    <p>Next up: get the setup projects (MSI projects) to increment their version numbers to match the TEAMCITY_BUILD
        number.</p>
