<h1>Credit Card Masking and Regular Expression in .Net</h1>
<p>Well contrary to what I would have thought, <a href="bing.com">bing.com</a> does not serve up any ready to use CC masking examples for VB.Net. I would have settled for C#. No luck. So I had to do some digging. I thought I'd lay this out there just so the next person with my exact problem doesn't have to look so long.</p>

<p>Step #1) Find a credit card number within a string.</p>

<p>No you may find lots of examples on how to find them precisely, but Iâ€™m willing to forgo a giant mess of regular expressions for a simpler one inspired by something I found at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1374482/c-find-replace-credit-cards-in-xml-string">StackOverflow:</a></p>

<p><code class="vb">"(\d[\s|-]?){12,15}\d"</code></p>

<p>The idea here is that we want to find 13 to 16 digits in a row separated by nothing except a single space or dash, and those are optional. This regular expression will return a positive result for 2134-5678-9090-1212 as well as 12345678 9090-1 and 1 2 3 4 5 6-7-8-909012. While the last two clearly aren't formatted as we expect a credit card number to be formatted, I'm willing risk that some non-credit card numbers may be accidentally masked. The likelihood that my project will encounter such a combination of numbers that is not a credit card is negligible, and my algorithm needs to be efficient. You of course may need to be more specific, but I have be willing to sacrifice some minor precision for speed.</p>

<p>My initial attempts to run the replace went something like this:</p>

<pre class="vb"><code>Imports System.Text.RegularExpressions
...
Public Function MaskCC(ByVal s As String) As String
  Return Regex.Replace(s, "(\d[\s|-]?){12,15}\d", "****************")
End Function</code></pre>

<p><code class="vb">MaskCC("you gave me 1234 5678 9090 1212 as your CC number")</code> returns<br>
    <samp>"you gave me **************** as your CC number"</samp></p>

<p>After some thought, I changed the requirements to display the last 4 digits so that we could still search in our data for CC transactions. So I modified it like this:</p>

<pre class="vb"><code>Public Function MaskCC(ByVal s As String) As String
  Return Regex.Replace(s, "(\d[\s|-]?){9,12}((\d[\s|-]?){3}\d)", "************$2")
End Function</code></pre>

<p><code class="vb">MaskCC("you gave me 1234 5678 9090 1212 as your CC number")</code> returns
    <samp>"you gave me ************1212 as your CC number"</samp></p>

<p>But then I was not satisfied since I couldn't distinguish between Amex and MC or Visa transactions. Amex cards only use fifteen numbers and I was adding 12 asterisks to the last four digits. In additional to not being able to distinguish those, debugging that oh-so-unlikely case where I mask a number not actually a CC number would be near impossible to notice. So I decided that I needed to mask only digits, and I wanted to do it precisely. So after some hunting I found some inspiration on <a href="http://dotnetperls.com/regex-replace-matchevaluator-vbnet">dotnetperls.com</a>. Here is what I came up with:</p>

<pre class="vb"><code>Public Function MaskCC(ByVal s As String) As String
  Return Regex.Replace(s, "(\d[\s|-]?){12,15}\d", New MatchEvaluator(AddressOf MaskCCMatch))
End Function

Private Function MaskCCMatch(ByVal match As Match) As String
  Dim CCnumber As String = match.ToString
  Return Regex.Replace(CCnumber.Substring(0, CCnumber.Length - 4), "\d", "*") & CCnumber.Substring(CCnumber.Length - 4)
End Function</code></pre>

<p><code class="vb">MaskCC("you gave me 1234 5678 9090 1212 as your CC number")</code> returns
    <samp>"you gave me **** **** **** 1212 as your CC number"</samp></p>

<p>Now I just need to benchmark how efficient it is now that I'm creating a MatchEvaluator class. Perhaps I should only initiate the MatchEvaluator once? How should I specify what character to mask with? Whatever I do, it must be thread safe. I guess that is something I can return to when I have more time.</p>
