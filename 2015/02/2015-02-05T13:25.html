    <h1>Resolving "No symbols have been loaded for this document" in web projects</h1>

    <img src="1.png" alt="No symbols have been loaded breakpoint alert">

    <p>I've run into this problem a number of times probably due to my own hackery. I must have copied a project wrong
        or something. It turns out that not too infrequently I'll start to debug a web project and IIS Express will
        start to host it, but in fact it is hosting the wrong code in a completely different folder.</p>

    <p>To resolve:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Right click IIS Express and note the site name and the ports it is hosted on.<br/>
            <img src="2.png" alt="IIS Express context menu"></li>
        <li>Now open C:\Users\<strong>&lt;username&gt;</strong>\Documents\IISExpress\config\applicationhost.config</li>
        <li>Search for the site name and the port name to find the right site element in the config file.<br/>
            <img src="3.PNG" alt="applicationhost.config"></li>
        <li>Verify that the virtualDirectory path is set to the correct folder. If it is not correct (as is clear in the
            above image), then correct the path and save the config file. Stop debugging and/or shutdown IIS Express.
            When you start debugging again, you should now be able to breakpoint code you previously could not due to
            "No symbols have been loaded for this document."
        </li>
    </ol>
