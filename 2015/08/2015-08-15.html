    <h1>Downgrading Windows for the first time in my life</h1>
    <p>I've not been burned by Microsoft in recent memory until two weeks ago. I think the Windows XP install I did over
        a decade ago was a little frustrating in that I had to retry it several times before the install actually
        completed, but apart from that I actually liked XP over 98. I liked Vista over XP (yes, really, and I think you
        folk who bad-mouthed Vista are delusional). I liked Windows 7 which was more like a Vista service pack, but you
        all were too full of irrational rage at Vista to see that Windows 7 was Vista with a different skin and a little
        faster. I liked Windows 8 over Windows 7 a lot. It was exciting to see how easily my kids who had never used a
        computer before could navigate Windows 8 with such ease. Windows 8.1 wasn't bad either but it was a little
        amusing to see Microsoft tell you start menu complainers to go pound sand with their "start menu" addition to
        Windows 8.1.</p>

    <p>Finally I upgraded Windows 8.1 on our family computer to Windows 10 two weeks ago. This was a bad decision. Not
        only do I think the UI backslid a little (thank goodness for tablet mode though), but they are missing critical
        features for managing accounts, especially child accounts.</p>

    <p>
        <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_security/family-safety-in-windows-10-missing-white-list/48347d69-7a53-4525-85f0-4601ceb3832a?page=4">I'm
            not alone.</a></p>

    <p>To manage a child's account, prevent them from accessing some apps and websites, I must first create an email
        account. An email account for a 3 year old is a bad idea, I don't care what your reason is for it.</p>

    <p>I cannot enable my child accounts to log in without entering a password, a pin, or some other authentication
        method. I used to be able to leave the account as a local account without a password. While I could teach my
        kids to use a password, a pin or whatever, this is annoying and frankly unnecessary from my perspective.</p>

    <p>I cannot enable "Whitelist only" on internet filtering. Instead they give me the option to black list and white
        list specific sites. Tell me how I'm supposed to itemize a black list for a global network that is probably 90%
        porn? <strong>This is a deal breaker right here.</strong></p>

    <p>I cannot whitelist apps either. Instead I have to wait for an app to be used before I can block it. Whoever wrote
        this feature I'm guessing doesn't have kids, or their kids are in constant danger of setting the house on fire
        -- but only once, after that the matches get put where the kids can't reach them.</p>

    <p>I might be able to dig up some other annoyances if I took the time, but the above mentioned ones make the
        transition from 8.1 not just painful, but impossible for my family.</p>

    <p>I'm downgrading Windows 10 back to Windows 8.1.</p>

    <p>Thankfully this is not hard. If you type in Recovery into the start menu, you can click on Recovery Options. You
        have a month from the Windows 10 upgrade to select Go Back to Windows 8.1.</p>
