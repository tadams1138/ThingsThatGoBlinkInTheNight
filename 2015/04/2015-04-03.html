    <h1>Running Unit Tests When TFS Build Definition Output Location is AsConfigured</h1>
    <del><p>I only just recently noticed that no tests were running for a couple of build definitions whose <strong>Output
        location</strong> was set to <strong>AsConfigured</strong>. I have a good reason to have the build definition
        set this way, but that is beside the point. The point is that the regular pattern set in <strong>Test source
            spec **\*test*.dll;**\*test*.appx</strong> was not finding any test libraries. Well, that's because the root
        folder defined by that pattern is the \bin folder for the build agent when what you need it to look in is the
        \src folder. I found the quick fix for this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/225680/y-shoham">Y.
            Shoham</a> on <a
                href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24208054/using-asconfigured-and-still-be-able-to-get-unittest-results-in-tfs">stackoverflow</a>.
        Use the following pattern in the <strong>Test source spec field</strong> of your build definition:</p>

        <p>..\src\**\*test*.dll;..\src\**\*test*.appx</p>

        <p>Now it should be able to find all test libraries when the <strong>Output location</strong> of your build
            definition is set to <strong>AsConfigured</strong>.</p></del>

    <p>Disregard everything I wrote. You will have a problem where test libraries in the <strong>obj</strong> folder
        will be run too, and those tests will fail. I have not been able to find a way to easily exclude the
        <strong>obj</strong> folder from the path I specify. I am forced to build all solution projects to one folder
        for now just like the <strong>Output location</strong> values <strong>SingleFolder</strong> and <strong>PerProject</strong>
        produce.</p>
