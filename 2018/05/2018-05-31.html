    <h1>Rule Set Designer</h1>
    <p>I added some features to the Microsoft RuleSetDialog to enable me to more easily design rule sets for client
        specific needs. I work a lot with rulesets treating them like client specific plugins to the company
        infrastructure. The RuleSetDialog pre-packaged with Windows Workflow libraries is very helpful when developing
        rules with its Intellisense based validation logic, but the dialog had some drawbacks I thought I'd improve
        upon. These features include the ability to resize the form so that you can take better advantage of your large
        monitors. <a href="https://github.com/tadams1138/RuleSetDesigner" target="_blank">Check it out</a>!</p>
