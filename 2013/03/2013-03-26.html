        <h1>Some observations on building frameworks</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I've had to work with multiple company frameworks in my career containing code common to many of the company
        apps. Each of these frameworks came with their own pros and cons. Here are just some observations I've made over
        the last few years regarding writing frameworks.</p>

    <h2>Frameworks</h2>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of an application framework is primarily make the process of application development easier and
        secondarily to make application development consistent. As such, the following rules should be followed when
        developing an application framework.</p>

    <h2>Backwards compatibility</h2>
    <p>Breaking changes forces existing application code to have to be altered and retested if the application is to
        take advantage of the new framework, and so breaking backwards compatibility may be among the worst things you
        can do.</p>

    <h2>Extendibility</h2>
    <p>A good framework does not force application development to find ways around it to meet their business needs. As
        such, framework elements should be separated into their logical parts and related to each other primarily by
        interfaces/contracts. This allows application developers to choose those parts of the framework that are most
        useful to them, and ignore the rest without having to hack code to work around those parts they can't use.</p>

    <p>For example: Many apps may use some kind of shared login screen (actual example)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>One class should contain all the code necessary to validate a user name and password - what to do if the
            login is invalid, what to do if the login is valid, etc.
        </li>
        <li>One completely separate class should contain the code necessary to access the database and return the
            necessary information that the above code needs to function.
        </li>
        <li>One or more classes could be built to use the above code and display it on a web page, in a windows form or
            WPF.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>They could all relate to each other through abstract interfaces/contracts so that any logical part could be
        swapped out by the application developer.</p>

    <p>For instance, most of this company's apps use SQL server, but if a developer was tasked with working with Oracle,
        there is no reason that code #1 and #3 in the framework shouldn't still be usable. We should only have to write
        some new code in the application to handle Oracle DBs, and connect it to the other two framework elements.</p>

    <p>If we change business rules, like we should lock Windows if the login fails enough times, then we should ideally
        still be able to use framework code #2 and #3 and only have to write new application code to handle new business
        rules.</p>

    <p>An application developer ideally should not have to wait for the framework to include these new changes for the
        business rules or the Oracle connection. They should be able to implement the abstract interfaces/contracts
        inside of their own projects and connect the framework code to their custom application work. The framework
        project can then add new code at its own pace. This has the added benefit of adding “tried and true”
        implementations to the framework as opposed to first attempt code (i.e. once the Oracle based app has gone live
        and is shown to be a success, then you can add the Oracle database code to the framework for everyone else to
        use).</p>

    <h2>Minimal Dependencies</h2>
    <p>Writing a framework is a balancing act. The above three classes may sound related to each other because they are
        all login related, but each carries with it potentially several dependencies. For example, if I'm using SQL
        server, I do not want to have to install Oracle drivers for my app to run just because I'm using the login
        screen. For that reason, framework components should be broken out into separate libraries, grouped based on
        common dependencies. It would be reasonable for instance to store classes for accessing an Oracle database for
        the login screen or the dictionary screen (another real example) in the same Company.Framework.Data.Oracle.dll
        library. It would also make sense to store the login screen UI code and the dictionary UI code in a library like
        Company.Framework.GUI.WPF.dll.</p>

    <h2>Company participation</h2>
    <h3>Distribution</h3>
    <p>There should be a centralized publishing location for the latest framework. I'd recommend using NuGet packages so
        that every development team is up to date.</p>

    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <p>A great framework is worthless if no one in the company knows anything about it, or worse if it takes more time
        to learn the framework than if the developer had written his application without the framework. As such,
        training and/or company-wide promotion of the framework is essential.</p>

    <h4>Unit tests</h4>
    <p>This might rub some people the wrong way, but that boiler plate XML based documentation usually does very little
        for programmers. Fact: The first thing a programmer looks for when working with any API is a code example. Well
        written unit tests combined with well named classes, methods and arguments do just that; they serve as an
        example for what behavior to expect from a class. They also serve to protect the code by detecting unpredicted
        behavior when code changes are made. I strongly recommend including unit test code in framework documentation,
        more so than XML based documentation.</p>

    <p>This recommendation does not detract in any way the role of software testers and QA.</p>

    <h3>Participation</h3>
    <p>There should be two way communication involved between the framework team and the framework users so that as
        elements of the framework are expanded upon (e.g. someone extends the login screen to handle Oracle DBs), those
        improvements can be reviewed and added into the framework.</p>

    <h2>General all-purpose development rules</h2>
    <h3>Follow coding standards</h3>
    <p>Enforce those standards on code check-in so that basic coding standards does not become the job of the code
        reviewer, but the job of the one writing the code in the first place.</p>

    <h3>Continuous Integration Builds</h3>
    <p>Every time a developer checks in code, all framework code should compile and all unit tests run. Just like the
        coding standards, if the compile or the tests fail, the code should be rejected and the developer that checked
        in the code should fix the problem.</p>

    <p>Neither of these two rules negates the role of the code reviewer.</p>

    <h2>Where to go from here if you have an existing mess of a framework</h2>
    <h3>Add to the existing framework using the above guidelines</h3>
    <p>In most of the instances I've encountered, I do not believe it is necessary to start from scratch on the legacy
        code.</p>

    <h3>Deprecate older elements as we go</h3>
    <p>As a fix to a component like the login screen is made, the code could be moved to match the above requirements,
        (i.e. separate out the DB, business rules, and GUI components into separate libraries), and the existing code
        could be marked “<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.obsoleteattribute.aspx">Obsolete</a>”.
        This will allow older applications to continue to run using the old code (i.e. we are <strong>not</strong>
        breaking compatibility), and it notifies new application developers to use the new framework code.</p>

    <h3>Do not isolate developers in the framework</h3>
    <p>Make a developer sleep in the bed he made. They will write better framework code if they know how it is being
        used. If at all possible, pool the “framework team” (if one is to exist) from many different projects expected
        to use the framework, and make them only work on it part of the time.</p>
