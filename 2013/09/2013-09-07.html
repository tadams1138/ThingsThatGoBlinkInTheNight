        <h1>The Reinvented Wheel</h1>
        <h2>A Cautionary Tale</h2>
    </header>

    <p>This is an example of code I had to delete by someone who must have thought they were being paid by the line.</p>

    <pre class="csharp"><code>public static string Space(UInt32 count = 1)
{
    string errorMessage = "Count must be an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to "
                          + CommonInteraction.OverflowProtection.ToString();

    if (count < 1 || count > CommonInteraction.OverflowProtection)
        throw new ArgumentException(errorMessage);

    StringBuilder spaceMaker = new StringBuilder();

    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        spaceMaker.Append(((char)32).ToString());

    return spaceMaker.ToString();
}</code></pre>

    <p>Clearly <code class="csharp">new string(' ', count);</code> would have sufficed in place of this entire method.
        But it gets worse. After finding all references to this nonsense, I found that the only two references to it
        were:</p>

    <p><code class="csharp">delimiter = CommonInteraction.Space().ToCharArray()[0];</code></p>

    <p>and</p>

    <p><code class="csharp">((TextBox)sender).Text = ((TextBox)sender).Text.Replace(CommonInteraction.Space(),
        string.Empty);</code></p>

    <p>Will someone please tell me what is wrong with just using a literal space character in these instances?!?!</p>

    <p>I don't know who you are. I don't know why you did this. If you are looking for me to approve your code for
        check-in, I can tell you that I don't have the patience for code like this. But what I do have are a very
        particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for
        people like you. If you never write code like this again, that'll be the end of it. But if you don't, I will
        look for your code, I will find it, and I will delete it.</p>
