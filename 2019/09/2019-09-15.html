        <h1>Multiple constructors an anti-pattern?</h1>
    </header>
    <p>I was attempting to <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?DecoratorPattern">decorate</a> the <a
            href="https://github.com/aspnet/HttpAbstractions/blob/2.2.0/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http/HttpContextFactory.cs">HttpContextFactory</a>
        in an AspNetCore project to to add features to the HttpContext at the time of its creation. I was able to
        perform the decoration in the Microsoft dependency injection framework using <a
                href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scrutor">Scrutor</a> in the project's Startup.cs file. It looked
        something like this:</p>

    <pre><code class="csharp">public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.Decorate&lt;IHttpContextFactory, DecoratingHttpContextFactory&gt;();
}</code></pre>

    <p>I encountered a null reference exception later though because the HttpContext property of the
        IHttpContextAccessor was never assigned. Line 41 of the HttpContextFactory is where this assignment would have
        been performed:</p>

    <pre><code class="csharp">if (_httpContextAccessor != null)
{
    _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext = httpContext;
}</code></pre>

    <p>You can also see that _httpContextAccessor is assigned on line 30 in the constructor. After some debugging I was
        able to conclude that the instantiation of the HttpContextFactory when the Microsoft dependency injection
        framework is given <code
                class="csharp">services.AddTransient&lt;IHttpContextFactory,HttpContextFactory&gt;();</code> on line 290
        of the <a
                href="https://github.com/aspnet/Hosting/blob/2.2.0/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting/WebHostBuilder.cs">WebHostBuilder</a>
        class is different from the way Scrutor chooses how to instantiate the class after I use the Decorate method.
        They have different strategies for picking which class constructor to use. Scrutor appears to choose the first
        constructor whose arguments can be supplied. Because the HttpContextFactory has two constructors, Scrutor picked
    </p>

    <pre><code class="csharp">public HttpContextFactory(IOptions&lt;FormOptions&gt; formOptions)
    : this(formOptions, httpContextAccessor: null)
{
}</code></pre>

    <p>The solution is fairly simple. Among many options you could just specify the constructor you want to use in the
        dependency injection framework like:</p>

    <pre><code class="csharp">public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient&lt;IHttpContextFactory&gt;(sp =&gt;
    {
        var formsOptions = sp.GetService&lt;IOptions&lt;FormOptions&gt;&gt;();
        var httpContextAccessor = sp.GetService&lt;IHttpContextAccessor&gt;();
        var httpContextFactory = new HttpContextFactory(formsOptions, httpContextAccessor);
        return new DecoratingHttpContextFactory(httpContextFactory);
    });
}</code></pre>

    <p>But more interestingly, it occurred to me that since I started using <a
            href="http://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment">Test Driven Development</a>, I can't remember the last time
        I used more than one constructor in a class that I also used in the dependency injector. Now there are some
        qualifiers like I've made internal constructors for the purpose of instantiating a class specifically for a test
        scenarios (I've since abandoned this practice), and I've had to include multiple constructors to help with
        serialization when I've implemented ISerializable. But in that last example, that was done primarily for Data
        Transfer Object (DTO) kinds of classes, classes that are more data structures than collections of behaviors. And
        I can't recall ever injecting a class like that using a dependency injection framework.</p>

    <p>Essentially since I started using TDD, my classes have a <a
            href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html">single
        responsibility</a> which I don't think lends to scenarios where more than one constructor would be helpful. The
        behavior of the HttpContextFactory in particular is a good example of what I'm suggesting is a problem. How does
        the Create method behave? It may or may not assign the newly created HttpContext to an IHttpContextAccessor
        instance. You don't know unless you also know how it was constructed. If for some reason you didn't want to use
        the HttpContextAccessor implementation as is certainly implied in both the HttpContextFactory implementation and
        the AddHttpContextAccessor extension method for IServiceCollection, then perhaps you could have employed the <a
                href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/specialCase.html">Null Object pattern</a> for an
        implementation of the IHttpContextAccessor. Or perhaps they chose to optionally deal with an
        IHttpContextAccessor to maintain backwards compatibility. If that was the case then they could have done what I
        did with the decorator patter and wrapped the original HttpContextFactory with an implementation that also
        assigns the HttpContext to the HttpContextAccessor. They could have used the AddHttpContextAccessor extension
        method to register this decorator class.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, it appears to me that the HttpContextAccessor does too much, and its behavior is dependent on
        which constructor you choose. Having multiple constructors, particularly if they affect behavior (is there any
        other kind?), seems to me to defeat much of the benefit of a good dependency injection framework. I shouldn't
        have to know which constructor will be used, and I won't have to know if there's only one constructor.</p>
