    <p>This post is inspired by the Gang of Four's brilliant work <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design Patterns</a>. Also I need to thank <a
            href="https://twitter.com/ibanezht">Heath Turnage</a> for suggesting the solution that I now call the
        Ruminant Pattern.</p>
    <h2>Intent</h2>
    <p>Provide a way to resume failed steps of a non-atomic sequence with minimal resources.</p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Often times I find myself needing to execute a sequence of operations that cannot be made atomic, where the
        operations may fail for various reasons, where the failed operations can be re-attempted, and where successful
        operations should not be re-run. Consider for instance a series of operations like</p>
    <pre class="csharp"><code>{
    var orderRequest = GetNextOrderFromQueue();
    SendClientReceivedNotification(orderRequest);
    var order = CreateOrder(orderRequest);
    NotifyVendors(order);
    SendClientInProgressNotification(order);
}</code></pre>

    <p>Imagine a scenario where each one of those operations involved a separate API call, and that a transaction
        solution that rolls back past operations is impracticle or impossible. If the CreateOrder step threw an
        exception because a database was unavailable, you could theoretically recover from the error by re-sending the
        same message to the queue to start the whole process all over again. But you'd re-send the received notification
        to the client, and this might be less than ideal. What if the vendor API could not be notified? If you re-send
        the same message to the queue after the failing vendor API came back online, you'd create a new order and
        re-send the client a received notification. One way to solve this might be to create as many queues and
        consumers as there are operations:</p>

    <img src="Slide1.PNG">

    <p>Then if an operation failed at any point in the sequence, you could recover from the error by re-sending the
        message that failed to the queue where it failed. The code may look something like the following spread across
        several consumer assemblies:</p>
    <pre class="csharp"><code>{
    var orderRequest = GetNextOrderFromQueue();
    SendClientReceivedNotification(orderRequest);
    SendOrderRequestToCreateOrderQueue(orderRequest);
}

{
    var orderRequest = GetNextOrderFromCreateOrderQueue();
    var order = CreateOrder(orderRequest);
    SendOrderToNotifyVendorsQueue(order);
}

{
    var order = GetNextOrderFromNotifyVendorsQueue();
    NotifyVendor(order);
    SendOrderToNotifyClientOrderInProgressQueue(order);
}

{
    var order = GetNextOrderFromNotifyClientOrderInProgressQueue();
    SendClientInProgressNotification(order);
}</code></pre>
    <p>Now the number of queues and consumers is equal to the number of atomic operations. You can probably see how this
        looks a little resource intensive. But what if an order can have multiple vendors like this?</p>
    <pre class="csharp"><code>{
    var order = GetNextOrderFromNotifyVendorsQueue();
    foreach (var service in order.Services)
    NotifyVendor(service);

    SendOrderToNotifyClientOrderInProgressQueue(order);
}</code></pre>
    <p>If one vendor notification API temporarily fails and we attempt to recover by re-queueing the message, we
        re-notify all previously successful vendor APIs. Could we try to make as many queues as there are vendors? How
        would we coordinate when they all succeed? This seems impractical.</p>

    <p>A better solution might be to create a data structure that can retain the state of the sequence of operations and
        pass it back to the same queue that started the sequence. Then we only have one queue and one queue-consumer for
        this sequence of operations, and any temporary failure can be re-attempted by re-sending the message associated
        with the last failure.</p>

    <p>This idea of regurgitating a message back up to the queue from which it originated for the purposes of moving on
        to the a next stage of processing reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant">a cow chewing
            its cud</a>.</p>
    <h2>Applicability</h2>
    <p>Use the Ruminant pattern when</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Queues or consumers are limited</li>
        <li>A sequence of operations cannot be made atomic, failed operations can be re-attempted but successful
            operations should not be re-attempted
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <img src="Slide2.PNG">
    <h2>Participants</h2>
    <h3>Producer</h3>
    <p>Sends a message to the queue.</p>
    <h3>Queue</h3>
    <p>Persists messages and releases them to a consumer in the order that they were added.</p>
    <h3>Consumer</h3>
    <p>Receives messages from a queue and performs a sequence of operations based on the content of the message.</p>
    <h2>Collaborations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Normally a single <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?FactoryPattern">factory</a> produces strategies to handle the
            messages consumed from the queue based on the state of the consumed message.
        </li>
        <li>A <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?StrategyPattern">strategy</a> handles a message to perform an atomic sequence
            of operations that can be re-attempted if there is a temporary exception.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Consequences</h2>
    <p>The Ruminant pattern has the following benefits and liabilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Limits the number of resources necessary to retry parts of a sequence that cannot be made atomic.</em>
            We only need the only queue and the one queue-consumer.
        </li>
        <li><em>Limits the scaffolding code and maintenance of multiple consumers used to complete a sequence of
            operations.</em> We don't have to duplicate the code necessary to scaffold out multiple queue-consumers.
        </li>
        <li><em>It creates bulkier messages designed to describe what stage of the sequence they apply to.</em> The
            messages now include properties like <em>"ClientReceivedNotificationSent": true.</em></li>
        <li><em>It obscures the sequence of operations and transfers that knowledge to something like a strategy
            factory.</em> A strategy factory may be employed to determine which strategy should operate on a message
            based on properties like <em>"ClientReceivedNotificationSent": true</em>. The order of operations will be
            based on message properties and not necessarily listed in sequential order.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>Here are some useful techniques for implementing the Ruminant pattern.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Message handling strategy factory</em>. Depending on the state of the message passed to the queue
            consumer, produce a single, testable strategy to handle the message that matches that state.
        </li>
        <li><em>Send the same message that was consumed back to the originating queue after first modifying a property
            that guarantees the next operation in the sequence.</em> Do this if there is another operation that follows
            the current atomic-operation-that-could-be-re-attempted-if-their-was-a-failure. For instance if a message
            was recieived like { "orderRequest": {...} } and the current strategy sent the client a "received"
            notification, you should re-queue to the originating queue a message that looked like { "orderRequest":
            {...}, "receivedNotification": true }.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sample</h2>
    <p>We'll apply the Ruminant pattern to creating the order discussed earlier.</p>

    <p>A consumer that accepts messages from a queue would be scaffolded to receive messages and deserialize them before
        handing them off to a message handler. The implementation may look something like this. For simplicity, the
        following example assumes dependencies are injected by a dependency injection framework.</p>
